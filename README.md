Real Estate House Price Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project on the house prices in Bengaluru, India. The purpose of this project is to investigate the factors that influence the house prices in Bengaluru and build machine learning models to predict the house prices.

The project uses a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains information on various features of houses such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques such as linear regression, Lasso, and Ridge regression to develop models to predict house prices based on these features.

The main code files are located in the "src" directory, while the data files are located in the "data" directory. The project report is located in the "docs" directory.

Prerequisites:

To run the code, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Installing:

You can install the required libraries using pip. Open the terminal and run:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage:

To run the project, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook in the "src" directory. The Jupyter notebook contains the code for the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models.
